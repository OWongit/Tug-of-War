# Tug-of-War
Builds a 2-player “Tug of War” game using multiple FSMs, where players press buttons to move a light across LEDs. The first to push it off the edge wins. Solves button input synchronization, test each part in ModelSim, then combine. Watches for metastability, and aims for a minimal design.
