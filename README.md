# Tug-of-War
Builds a 2-player “Tug of War” game using multiple FSMs, where players press buttons to move a light across LEDs. The first player to push the light off the edge wins. Addresses button input synchronization, tests each part in ModelSim, and then combines them. Monitors for metastability and aims for a minimal design.
